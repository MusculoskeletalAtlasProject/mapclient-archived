    * A way to declare a mount point for plugins. Since plugins are an example 
      of loose coupling, there needs to be a neutral location, somewhere between
      the plugins and the code that uses them, that each side of the system can
      look at, without having to know the details of the other side. Trac calls
      this an 'extension point'.
    * A way to register a plugin at a particular mount point. Since internal code
      can't (or at the very least, shouldn't have to) look around to find plugins 
      that might work for it, there needs to be a way for plugins to announce their
      presence. This allows the guts of the system to be blissfully ignorant of 
      where the plugins come from; again, it only needs to care about the mount point.
    * A way to retrieve the plugins that have been registered. Once the plugins 
      have done their thing at the mount point, the rest of the system needs to
      be able to iterate over the installed plugins and use them according to its need.

    For compatibility across python 2.x and python 3.x we must construct the PluginMountPoint
